# MeetAI

In today's fast-paced environment, video calls often lead to important discussions and decisions. However, for hosts, generating new ideas to engage the audience can be challenging at times, and taking notes during a presentation can be inconvenient. Manual summarization often misses critical details.

MeetAI is an AI powered video call platform that provides real-time feedback leveraging advanced technologies such as Fetch.AI's AI agents, Google's Gemini AI, SingleStore's vector databases, and Agora's real time voice and video capabilities to transform how meetings are documented and actioned.

MeetAI generates a concise summary of the key points discussed, a detailed list of notes, including key decisions made, action items with assigned responsibilities, important deadlines, and any unresolved issues or next steps all while the video call is going on. This feedback-driven cycle allows the host to make assisted decisions on how to continue to go on with the meeting.
